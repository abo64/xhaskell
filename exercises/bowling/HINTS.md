## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `Bowling`
and implement the following functions:

- `bowlingStart` returns an empty `Bowling`.
- `roll` evaluates an input roll, returning the new `Bowling`.
- `score` calculates the total score at the end if it is regular game.

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
